        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am an experienced Solution Architect with more than 35 years in telecom, IT infrastructure, managed services, and enterprise architecture. Throughout my career, I’ve specialized in translating complex technical needs into clear, structured solutions — from global network designs to fully scoped managed services SOWs.</p>                                                                                                                                       
        <p>I excel in documentation, service modeling, and cross-functional teamwork. I’m currently expanding into technical writing and web development, while seeking remote-first work that leverages my writing, solutioning, and architecture background.</p>
        <p>I value clarity, structure, and practical design — both in technology and in the way I build things in my personal life.</p>
